Feature: As a user I can complete a BigblueButtonBN activity by usual or custom criteria

  Background:  Make sure that a course is created
    Given a BigBlueButton mock server is configured
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname    | shortname | category | enablecompletion |
      | Test course | C1        | 0        | 1                |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity        | name           | intro                           | course | idnumber         | type | recordings_imported |
      | bigbluebuttonbn | RoomRecordings | Test Room Recording description | C1     | bigbluebuttonbn1 | 0    | 0                   |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                 |
      | traverst | Terry     | Travers  | t.travers@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role    |
      | traverst | C1     | student |

  Scenario: I set the completion to standard type of completion.
    Given I am on the "RoomRecordings" "bigbluebuttonbn activity editing" page logged in as admin
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Completion tracking | Show activity as complete when conditions are met |
      | Require view        | 1                                                 |
    And I press "Save and display"
    And I log out
    Given I am on the "RoomRecordings" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as traverst
    And I am on the "Test course" course page
    Then I should see "Done: View"
