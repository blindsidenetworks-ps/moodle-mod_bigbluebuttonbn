  @javascript
  Scenario: When I create a BBB activity as a teacher who cannot access all groups,
  I should only be able to select the group I belong on the main bigblue button page.
    Given the following "permission overrides" exist:
      | capability                  | permission | role           | contextlevel | reference |
      | moodle/site:accessallgroups | Prevent    | editingteacher | Course       | C1        |
    When I am on the "RoomRecordings" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "teacher1"
    Then I should see "Separate groups: Group 1"

  @javascript
  Scenario: When I create a BBB activity as a teacher, I should only be able to specify individual "User" participants with whom I share a group with (or can view on the course participants screen).
    When I am on the "RoomRecordings" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "teacher1"
    Then I should see "Group 1" in the "select[name='group']" "css_element"
    And I should see "Group 2" in the "select[name='group']" "css_element"

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: When I view a BBB activity as a student in a course with separate groups, I should only be able to see Recordings from my group
    When I am on the "RoomRecordings" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "<user>"
    Then I <G1> "Recording G1"
    And I <G2> "Recording G2"
    And I <NO> "Recording No group"

    Examples:
      | user  | G1             | G2             | NO             |
      | user1 | should see     | should not see | should not see |
      | user2 | should not see | should see     | should not see |
      | user3 | should not see | should not see | should not see |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: When I view a BBB activity as a student in a course with visible group set, I should be able to see Recordings from my group or
  the default meeting if I am not in a group.
    When I am on the "RoomRecordingsVisibleGroups" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "user3"
    And I select "<groupname>" from the "group" singleselect
    Then I <G1> "Recording G1b"
    And I <G2> "Recording G2b"
    And I <NO> "Recording No group C2"

    Examples:
      | groupname        | G1             | G2             | NO             |
      | All participants | should see     | should see     | should see     |

      | Group 2          | should not see | should see     | should not see |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: When I view a BBB activity as a student in a course with visible group set, I should be able to join meeting if not I should not see the activity
    When I am on the "<Activity>" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "<user>"
    Then I should see "<Message>"

      | user  | Activity                    | Message                                                     |
