  @javascript
  Scenario: Add three room activities to an existent course
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I create a course with:
      | Course full name | Test Course |

    And I follow "Test Course"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "BigBlueButton" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Instance type | Room/Activity with recordings |
      | Virtual classroom name | RoomRecordings |
    Then I should see "RoomRecordings"
    When I follow "RoomRecordings"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    Then I should see "RoomRecordings"
    And I should see "This conference room is ready. You can join the session now."
    # The button is now a link.
    And I should see "Join session"
    And I should see "Recordings"
    When I follow "testcourse"
