  @javascript
  Scenario: I check that I can import recordings into the Recording Only activity from other activities
  the imported recordings are only visible in one activity (CONTRIB-7961)
    When I log in as "admin"

    Then I go to the courses management page
    And I follow "Test Course 2"
    Then I follow "View"
    Then I follow "RecordingsOnly1"
    Then I click on "Import recording links" "button"
    Then I select "Test Course 1" from the "import_recording_links_select" singleselect
      # add the first recording
    And I click on "td.lastcol a" "css_element"
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    Then I click on "Yes" "button"
    Then I wait until the page is ready
      # add the second recording
    And I click on "td.lastcol a" "css_element"
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    Then I click on "Yes" "button"
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    And I click on "Go back" "button"
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    Then I go to the courses management page
    And I follow "Test Course 2"
    Then I follow "View"
    Then I follow "RecordingsOnly1"
    And I should see "Recording 1"
    And I should see "Recording 2"
