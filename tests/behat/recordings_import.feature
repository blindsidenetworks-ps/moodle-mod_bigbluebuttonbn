  @javascript
  Scenario: I check we display the right information (Recording Name as name and Description)
    When I am on the "RoomRecordings1" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "admin"
    # We check column names regarding changes made in CONTRIB-7703.
    Then I should not see "Recording" in the ".mod_bigbluebuttonbn_recordings_table thead" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Meeting" in the ".mod_bigbluebuttonbn_recordings_table thead" "css_element"
    And I should see "Name" in the ".mod_bigbluebuttonbn_recordings_table thead" "css_element"

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: I check that I can import recordings into the Recording activity from other activities
    When I am on the "<instancename>" "bigbluebuttonbn activity" page logged in as "admin"
    And I click on "Import recording links" "button"
    And I select "Test Course 1 (C1)" from the "sourcecourseid" singleselect
    And I select "RoomRecordings" from the "sourcebn" singleselect
    # add the first recording
    And I click on "a.action-icon" "css_element" in the "Recording 1" "table_row"
    # add the second recording
    And I click on "a.action-icon" "css_element" in the "Recording 2" "table_row"
    And I click on "Go back" "button"
    Then "Recording 1" "table_row" <existence>
    And "Recording 2" "table_row" <existence>
    Examples:
      | instancename    | existence    |
      | RecordingOnly   | should exist |

    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I click on "Go back" "button"
    # This should be refactored with the right classes for the table element
    # We use javascript here to create the table so we don't get the same structure.
