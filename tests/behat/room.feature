    #Then I click on "th[data-yui3-col-id='date'] .yui3-datatable-sort-indicator" "css_element"
    #Then "Recording 1" "text" should appear before "Recording 3" "text"
    #Then "Recording 3" "text" should appear before "Recording 2" "text"
    #Then "Recording 2" "text" should appear before "Recording 4" "text"
    #Then I click on "th[data-yui3-col-id='date'] .yui3-datatable-sort-indicator" "css_element"
    #Then "Recording 1" "text" should appear after "Recording 3" "text"
